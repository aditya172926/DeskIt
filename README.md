# DeskHub

A Desktop app for exploring and working with Open Source Repositories

## Made using
- Rust for Backend to write logic under commands which can be called from the frontend
- ReactJS for Frontend
- Antd for UI components

Currently, DeskHub builds are available only as windows .msi files and are not released in public as it is still under development.
