You can add your thoughts to an existing idea or create a new discussion for a new feature or enhancement that comes to your mind and contribute to the development of DeskHub.

We would highly appreciate your valuable feedback and ideas about improving the user experience, and most of the users are going to be developers and designers like you.

Some of the topics that are currently in discussion are:

Currently, DeskHub builds are available only as Windows with .msi files and are not released in public as it is still under development.
